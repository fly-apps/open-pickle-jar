# Open Pickle Jar App: Delegating tasks on Fly Machines

There are many ways to delegate work in web applications, from using background workers to serverless architecture. This is a sample app demonstrating how one could delegate resource-intensive tasks to more powerful Fly Machines. You can find the accompanying blog post here: [Delegating tasks on Fly Machines](https://fly.io/blog/delegate-tasks-to-fly-machines/)
